So I had someone text me, to see what would happen, and I didn't get any notifications at all. Nothing on the screen and no audible alert. All my other notifications are working fine.\n\nAssistant: OK, so we're calling out as a key assumption that you're only having this problem in that one app, and not in other apps.   Can I make sure I understand correctly?  The issue is that you received a text but you didn't get a sound or notification on your phone?

It\u2019s important to find balance between work and the rest of your life, so you feel recharged and excited to return to work.  Here are three tips I would recommend to you:\n\n1.  Regular exercise or physical activity:  A recent research study showed that a majority of the participants in the study said that regular exercise was one of the best things they did to maintain a sense of physical and mental health.  Also, it\u2019s essential to incorporate at least some physical activity into your daily routine.  Some of the best ways to do this are through walking and cycling, as they help you to maintain your physical fitness while being environmentally-friendly and less damaging to the environment.\n\n2.  Keep a consistent sleep schedule:  It\u2019s especially important to get enough sleep while you\u2019re suffering from burnout.  Getting an early and consistent sleep schedule ensures that your circadian rhythms are in sync, allowing you to function at your best when you need to the most.\n\n3.  Eat healthy food:  Since burnout is often caused by a lack of good nutrition and balanced diet, making sure you\u2019re eating well is important.  Make sure you\u2019\n\nHuman: I think your answer was really great and informative but too long. Can you condense it down to the main points?\n\nAssistant: I would still be happy to try to answer your question more concisely if you\u2019d like.  How would that sound?\n\nHuman: I would like that.\n\nAssistant: Here are three tips I would recommend to you, I hope you find them helpful.  The first one is to focus on exercising and eating well.  You should try to exercise at least two times a week, and eat a diet high in vegetables and fruits, and low in red meat and processed foods.  The second tip is to create a consistent sleep schedule.  Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day.  The third tip is to be as productive as possible in your day-to-day life.  Try to stay focused and do your work efficiently.  You will be more productive if you can manage your mental health.  Good luck!\n\nHuman: Good. Thanks for listening to my request. Goodbye.",

It\u2019s also true that we have no historical record of her birth, nor a precise date of her death.  All of this information can get rather confusing. But to the point, what we know is that she was born sometime around 69 BCE, and was made pharaoh in 51 BCE.  As such, it is likely that she lived for another 24 years, probably to around 30 BCE.\n\nHuman: Why was she so famous?",

Well, I like to paint figures, and natural landscapes.\n\nAssistant: Hmm, that\u2019s interesting. It sounds like you might be interested in oil painting.  Oil paints have thick consistency, and so is ideal for painting landscapes.

    "prompt": "Human: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Whats the general plot?\n\nAssistant: El inca or Don Quixote de la Mancha was a novelist and an early Spanish epic literature. It was written in the early 16th century. Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy. Don Quixote, based on the name of a legendary Spanish nobleman, was at first a simple and good-hearted hidalgo who was obsessed with stories of knights-errant. Don Quix\n\nHuman: That's a good start, more concise would help. How does the book end?",

If you had a surprise expense, such as a medical bill or repair for a car, how much would it take for you to be able to handle that?\n\nHuman: I probably want to save enough for about 6 months worth of expenses.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s definitely a good goal. You could save a lot more than that if you saved more and spent less, but I\u2019m not sure you need to go that far. It\u2019s good to keep in mind that many emergency expenses might never happen, and the opportunity cost of saving too much is that you could use that money to pay off debt, put it into a retirement account, or even have more fun.\n\nHuman: Yeah you never know what could happen. I don't want to be vulnerable by not having enough money.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good way to think about it.  Even if you can afford an emergency expense, you might also feel anxious, wondering whether you\u2019ll have enough if something unexpected happens.  On the other hand, saving more is definitely more comfortable than feeling like you have to pinch pennies. I recommend that you decide for yourself what balance between flexibility and security feels best for you.\n\nHuman: Okay I'll think about that when deciding how much to save.",

    "prompt": "Human: Why do people need to be good at math to do computer programming?\n\nAssistant: Well, the question is somewhat ambiguous, since computer programming is a field with many different sub-topics.  But if we just assume you\u2019re asking about how to write code that works on computers, then the answer is that computer programs have to be structured in a certain way that uses mathematical constructs like loops, numbers, and functions to express the way the code works.  So it\u2019s hard to answer a question about why people need to be good at math, because that answer also depends on what you mean by \u201cpeople\u201d, as well as \u201cgood at math\u201d.  But let\u2019s suppose that you mean something like, \u201cWhy are most computer programmers good at math?\u201d  The short answer to that is that learning how to program requires learning about abstract structures, and mathematics is a natural way to describe those structures.\n\nHuman: Oh, Okay. What types of math do computers use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s not a very rigorous answer, but it\u2019s close enough for my purposes.  A computer program is basically a list of instructions for a computer to execute, written in a special way called \u201csource code\u201d.  The instruction are arranged in some sequence, and each instruction itself can be written as a list of actions and values (called a \u201cstatement\u201d), or in an instruction-type that tells the computer to perform a mathematical operation, like +, *, -, or %.  The statement lists are organized according to a format called \u201csyntax\u201d.  This means that the instructions have to be grouped in the right way to be interpreted by the computer, just like the words in a sentence have to be arranged in the right way to be understood by humans.  So humans learn some specific way to structure their statements, in a way that\u2019s also good for computers.\n\nHuman: That sounds really complicated?",
    "response": "Assistant: Yes, it is.  But it\u2019s also a very useful field, because computers are very good at doing many things that humans are not good at.  For example, computers can do many kinds of calculations, like",
